SimpleTask: A Minimal Client‑Side Checklist

SimpleTask is a tiny, no‑frills checklist you can open and use instantly.

Objective

- A very minimal client‑side checklist. No backend, no API calls, no accounts. It’s just a simple task manager you can use without friction. Data is kept locally in your browser (localStorage) and never leaves your device.

Why it exists

- Created by Daniel Cabanas, frustrated by the lack of truly simple, free checklists that don’t store or use your data without need or consent.

Features

- Add tasks (press Enter), mark done/undone, remove tasks.
- Two sections: “Do” and “Done” (Done section hides when empty).
- Live drag‑and‑drop reordering in the “Do” section; order is persisted.
- Import/Export tasks as JSON (overwrites current tasks on import).
- Light/Dark theme toggle.
- Mobile‑friendly sizing; 100% client‑side — no servers or endpoints.
