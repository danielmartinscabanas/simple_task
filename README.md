# SimpleTask — Minimal Client-Side Checklist

SimpleTask is a tiny, no-frills checklist you can open and use instantly.

Objective:
- A very minimal client-side checklist. No backend, no API calls, no accounts, no tracking. It’s just a simple task manager you can use without friction.

Why it exists:
- Created by Daniel Cabanas, who was frustrated that there wasn’t a truly simple, free way to make checklists without big tech storing or using your data without need or consent.

What you get:
- Add tasks (press Enter), mark done/undone, remove tasks.
- Two sections: “Do” and “Done”.
- Drag to reorder tasks in the “Do” section.
- Light/Dark theme toggle.
- 100% client-side — no endpoints, no server.

Enjoy it!
